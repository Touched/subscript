## Subscript

Subscript is a limited subset of Python, written using Python's own AST, designed to make scripting intuitive and fun.

## Installation

Subscript depends on PyGObject (with GtkSpell and GtkSourceView) for the GUI. The emulator module depends on libatlantis, which must be cloned and built before the GUI can be used.
